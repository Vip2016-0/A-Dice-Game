# A-Dice-Game
A game played between 2 people, 2 dice are thrown and player having bigger number on dice wins the game.

Hello,

In this project front end is made up of basic HTML and CSS.
For random generation of numbers for dice random() function of javascript is used.
It is a simple game made up of using basic features of JavaScript such as DOM Model, querySelector etc.

I am providing some snapshots of game:-


Player 1 dice has greater number, so player 1 won.
